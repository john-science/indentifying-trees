# tree-id

Just my personal notes trying to learn to identify trees.


## Why does this site exists?

1. I like trees.
2. I want to try out Vue.js.


## Educational Notes

#### Vue.js

Well, it's that time again:

> Time to learn another JavaScript Framework.

#### Multi-Page Vue.js Apps

This was more work than in needed to be. And very poorly documented on the vue.js site.

I (loosely) followed the example [here](https://github.com/chriscalo/vue-multipage).
