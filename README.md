# tree-id

Just my personal notes trying to learn to identify trees.


## Why does this site exists?

1. I like trees.
2. I want to try out Vue.js.

## License

The code is licensed here at GPLv3. That means you are free to use the enclosed software (and even the photographs here-in). But you must fully disclose the source of the code.

The is particularly important if you intend to use the photographs of trees and tree features.

If you are using these photos for non-profit, eductational works, please just ask and I will probably break my copyright/license for you. (I also have dramatically higher resolution copies of all of
these photos, if you need.)


## Educational Notes

#### Vue.js

Well, it's that time again:

> Time to learn another JavaScript Framework.

#### Multi-Page Vue.js Apps

This was more work than in needed to be. And very poorly documented on the vue.js site.

I (loosely) followed the example [here](https://github.com/chriscalo/vue-multipage).
